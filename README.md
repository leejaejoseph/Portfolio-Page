# Joseph Lee: Portfolio Page

Hello! My name is Joseph Lee, and I am a front-end web developer having shifted from media marketing. I created this portfolio to showcase my skills and experience to potential employers and clients, and to share my passion for creating beautiful, functional web applications.
For this project, I utilized a variety of different platforms and frameworks including Blender, AfterEffects, and GLTF. Experimenting with different libraries and tools, my goal was to create a different take on a personal portfolio. I'm excited to share my work with you, and I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio!
